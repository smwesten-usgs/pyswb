Experimental soil-water-balance code in Python.

This repo contains some bare-bones implementations of some of the key algorithms that are used in the
USGS Soil-Water-Balance Code (Westenbroek and others, 2010; Westenbroek and others, 2018). The purpose
of this repo is to serve as a way to implement further tests of the existing Fortran code, as well 
as to provide a test bed for possible future additions to the SWB code.

This code is untested and unsupported. Use at your own risk!
